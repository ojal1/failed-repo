# C - printf
(Group proyect) 
By: Osvaldo Antompietri and Juan Collazo

# Project Description
We are creating a program that can print out different types of information by the user.
Currently, we are going to focus on the most common ones for how to print: integers, single characters, string of characters, and the percent sign.

# Intention of functions for Format Specifiers

1) Being able to print a 'int' (%d).

2) Being able to print a 'unsigned int' (%i).

3) Being able to print a 'char' (%c).

4) Being able to print a 'char []' (%s).

5) Being able to print a 'Percent sign' (%%).

# Example of printf function

- _printf("Hello, Holberton\n") prints "Hello, Holberton", followed by a new line
- _printf("%s", "Hello") prints "Hello"
- _printf("This is a number: %d", 98) prints "This is a number: 98"

# Files
The primary file being utilized is _printf.c wich contains the _printf function itself. This file is linked to a heder file named main.h, as well as function prototypes for functions.c.

A man page has been included, called man_3_printf.
